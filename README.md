# statistics-lessons

This repository is a collection of jupyter notebooks that I created while taking
a Stochastic Process course at Purdue (MA532). The purpose of these notebooks is
to gain additional exposure to the course material. Each notebook is a self-contained
example problem with explinations throughout the solution.

## Content

The topcs that were touched upon in this repository are listed below based on the
notebook:

* `rejection_sampling`
  * rejection sampling
  * monte carlo simulation
* `birth_death_simulation`
  * birth-death processes
  * the M/M/1 queue
  * continuous time markov chains
  * discrete time embedded markov chains
  * tricks to make simulation more practical
